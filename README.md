# Project 1.    

This project is the first of four in which we are to hand in for the Code Institute Full Stack Diploma. In this project we were asked to: Design an interactive Front-End web application using HTML and CSS based on the principles of user experience design, accessibility and responsivity.

## Assessment Criteria 1
1) Design a website that incorporates a main navigation menu and a structured layout. ![navbar](https://i.ibb.co/QdP9vvX/Screen-Shot-2022-11-29-at-4-50-07-PM.png)

2) Design a website that meets accessibility guidelines (e.g. contrast between background and foreground colours, non-text elements have planned alt text equivalents to cater for the visually impaired).

| White | ![#FFFFFF](https://www.colorhexa.com/ffffff.png) #FFFFFF |
| Black | ![#000000](https://www.colorhexa.com/000000.png) #000000 |



3) Design the organisation of information on the page following the principles of user experience design (headers are used to convey structure, information is easy to find due to being presented and categorised in terms of priority).

4) Ensure that foreground information is never distracted by backgrounds.

5) Include graphics that are consistent in style and colour

/* icons are inspired by formula ones Instagram and social media icons in which are used widely on all global sites.ÃŸ

## Assessment Criteria 2 
Test a Front-End web application through the development, implementation and deployment stages


1)	Create a website of at least three pages, or (if using a single scrolling page) at least three separate page areas to match the design and to meet its stated purpose

2)	Write custom HTML code that passes through the official W3C validator with no issues. SKAL AENDRES SO.

3)	Write custom CSS code that passes through the official (Jigsaw) validator with no issues

4)	Incorporate images that are of sufficient resolution to not appear pixelated or stretched // Pictures on website with 400px diff.

5)	Code all external links to open in a separate tab when clicked

6)	Use CSS media queries across the application to ensure the layout changes appropriately and maintains the page's structural integrity across device screen sizes. This process can be found below 371 in style.css.

7)	Use Semantic markup to structure HTML code / Done with sections and divs.

8)	Present the finished website with clearly understandable site-specific content, rather than Lorem Ipsum placeholder text

Font is found, looking alot like the actual F1 font, which was nearly impossible to optain due to copyright.

9)	Implement clear navigation to allow users to find resources on the site intuitively. YT-links provides mentioned information. Links will guide user towards pages with more information.

## Assessment Criteria 3

Deploy a Front-End web application to a Cloud platform

1)	Deploy a final version of the code to a cloud-based hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages) and test to ensure it matches the development version

2)	Use Git & GitHub for version control of an interactive web application up to deployment. // Check 
3)	Remove commented-out code before pushing final changes to version control and deploying. // Check
4)	Ensure that there are no broken internal links // Check
5)	Insert screenshots of the finished project in the README Well.... Welcome..

## Assessment Criteria 4
Maximise future maintainability through documentation, code structure and organisation

1	Write a README.md file for the web application that explains its purpose, the value that it provides to its users, and the deployment procedure.
2	Insert screenshots of the project features, give a brief description of what each feature does and explain its value to the user.
3	Attribute all code from external sources to its original source via comments above the code and (for larger dependencies) in the README.
4	Clearly separate and identify code written for the website and code from external sources (e.g. libraries or tutorials)
5	Organise HTML and CSS code into well-defined and commented sections
6	Place CSS code in external files linked to the HTML page in the HEAD element.
7	Write code that meets at least minimum standards for readability (consistent indentation, blank lines only appear individually or, at most, in pairs)
8	Name files consistently and descriptively, without spaces or capitalisation to allow for cross-platform compatibility.
9	Group files in directories by file type (e.g. an assets directory will contain all static files and may be organised into sub-directories such as CSS, images, etc.)

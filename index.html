        <h2>Qualifying</h2>
        <p>Verstappen improved to take first place on the timesheets, setting the time on the faster soft-compound tyres locked him into starting the race on Sunday, and Hamilton was likewise locked into using the more durable medium-compound tyres.[21] In the third and final qualifying session, Verstappen was able to use the slipstream of his teammate Sergio PÃ©rez to secure pole position for the race, with Hamilton only able to take the second spot on the grid.</p>

        <h2>Race Start</h2>
        <p>The race started at 17:00 local time and Lewis Hamilton immediately took the lead from Max Verstappen on the race start, prompting Verstappen to attempt to regain his position at the turn 6 chicane. Verstappen's trajectory forced Hamilton off the track, and the Briton re-entered slightly further ahead of the Dutch driver than he was before the corner. Arguing that he should have ceded the position to Verstappen, Red Bull Racing protested the racing line taken by Hamilton, and were told by radio that Hamilton had ultimately given back any advantage gained. Hamilton then utilised the durability of his medium-compound tyres to extend his lead over Verstappen, whose soft-compound tyres were suffering from greater degradation</p>
